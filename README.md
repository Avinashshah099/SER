# Speech Emotion Recognition Project for Intel Edge AI Scholarhip Challenge 2020 SpeechVINO study group

## Goal:
Develop a speech emotion recognition application to be deployable at the edge using Intel's OpenVINO Toolkit.

## Plan of Attack:
1. Do prelimiary research on similar work done in the area
2. Find out what has not been tried before and then attack this gap of research accordingly: In our case, to first project audio recordigns into spetrogram representations so as to enable deep learning with CNN instead of RNN-LSTM architecture(s)
3. Train our model(s) based on couple different NN architectures, then compare and refine. 
4. Convert to Intermediate Representations with OpenVINO Toolkit.
The rest => TODO

## Sample Repos Serves as an Example for Workflow: 
https://github.com/meshaun9/openvino_speech_recognition
* We will need to specify the hardware and software requirements for the setup
* We could use either a `.py` or `.ipynb` file for organizing and running our code
